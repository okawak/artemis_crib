This project tries to follow the \href{https://semver.org/}{\texttt{ semver policy}} -\/ although not followed 100\% in the past.

Usually an entry of \{\{\% badge style=\char`\"{}warning\char`\"{} title=\char`\"{} \char`\"{} \%\}\}Breaking\{\{\% /badge \%\}\} on the \href{basics/migration}{\texttt{ What\textquotesingle{}s new}} page causes a new major release number.

All other entries on the \href{basics/migration}{\texttt{ What\textquotesingle{}s new}} page will increase the minor release number.

Releases resulting in a new major or minor number are called main release.

Releases containing bugfixes only, are only increasing the patch release number. Those releases don\textquotesingle{}t result in announcements on the \href{basics/migration}{\texttt{ What\textquotesingle{}s new}} page.

Entries on the \href{basics/migration}{\texttt{ What\textquotesingle{}s new}} page are checked and enforced during the {\ttfamily version-\/release} Git\+Hub Action.\hypertarget{md_themes_relearn_exampleSite_content_dev_maintaining__index_en_autotoc_md972}{}\doxysubsection{Managing Issues}\label{md_themes_relearn_exampleSite_content_dev_maintaining__index_en_autotoc_md972}
Issues are categorized and managed by assigning \href{\#labels}{\texttt{ labels}} to it.

Once working on an issue, assign it to a fitting maintainer.

When done, close the ticket. Once an issue is closed, it needs to be assigned to next release milestone.

A once released ticket is not allowed to be reopened and rereleased in a different milestone. This would cause the changelog to be changed even for the milestone the issue was previously released in. Instead write a new ticket.\hypertarget{md_themes_relearn_exampleSite_content_dev_maintaining__index_en_autotoc_md973}{}\doxysubsection{Managing Pull Requests}\label{md_themes_relearn_exampleSite_content_dev_maintaining__index_en_autotoc_md973}
If a PR is merged and closed it needs an accompanied issue assigned to. If there is no issue for a PR, the maintainer needs to create one.

You can assign multiple PRs to one issue as long as they belong together.

Usually set the same labels and milestone for the PR as for the accompanied issue.\hypertarget{md_themes_relearn_exampleSite_content_dev_maintaining__index_en_autotoc_md974}{}\doxysubsection{Labels}\label{md_themes_relearn_exampleSite_content_dev_maintaining__index_en_autotoc_md974}

\hypertarget{md_themes_relearn_exampleSite_content_dev_maintaining__index_en_autotoc_md980}{}\doxysubsection{Making Releases}\label{md_themes_relearn_exampleSite_content_dev_maintaining__index_en_autotoc_md980}
A release is based on a milestone named like the release itself -\/ just the version number, eg\+: {\ttfamily 1.\+2.\+3}. It\textquotesingle{}s in the maintainers responsibility to check \href{\#semver}{\texttt{ semver semantics}} of the milestone\textquotesingle{}s name prior to release and change it if necessary.

Making releases is automated by the {\ttfamily version-\/release} Git\+Hub Action. It requires the version number of the milestone that should be released. The release will be created from the {\ttfamily main} branch of the repository.

Treat released milestones as immutable. Don\textquotesingle{}t rerelease an already released milestone. An already released milestone may already been consumed by your users.

During execution of the action a few things are checked. If a check fails the action fails, resulting in no new release. You can correct the errors afterwards and rerun the action.

The following checks will be enforced


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the milestone exists
\item there is at least one closed issue assigned to the milestone
\item all assigned issues for this milestone are closed
\item if it\textquotesingle{}s a main release, there must be a new {\ttfamily $<$major$>$.$<$minor$>$} at the beginning of the \href{basics/migration}{\texttt{ What\textquotesingle{}s new}} page
\item if it\textquotesingle{}s a patch release, there must be the {\ttfamily $<$major$>$.$<$minor$>$} from the previous release at the beginning of the \href{basics/migration}{\texttt{ What\textquotesingle{}s new}} page
\end{DoxyItemize}

After a successful run of the action


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the \href{https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/basics/history/index.html}{\texttt{ History}} page is updated, including release version, release date and text
\item the \href{https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/basics/migration/index.html}{\texttt{ What\textquotesingle{}s new}} page is updated, including release version, release date and text
\item the version number for the {\ttfamily $<$meta generator$>$} is updated
\item the updated files are committed
\item the milestone is closed
\item the repository is tagged with the version number (eg. {\ttfamily 1.\+2.\+3}), the main version number (eg. {\ttfamily 1.\+2.\+x}) and the major version number (eg. {\ttfamily 1.\+x})
\item a new entry in the \href{https://github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn/releases}{\texttt{ Git\+Hub release list}} with the according changelog will be created
\item the \href{https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/index.html}{\texttt{ official documentation}} is built and deployed
\item the version number for the {\ttfamily $<$meta generator$>$} is updated to a temporary and committed (this helps to determine if users are running directly on the main branch or are using releases)
\item a new milestone for the next patch release is created (this can later be renamed to a main release if necessary)
