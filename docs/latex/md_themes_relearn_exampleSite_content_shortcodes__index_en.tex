Hugo uses Markdown for its simple content format. However, there are a lot of things that Markdown doesnâ€™t support well. You could use pure HTML to expand possibilities.

But this happens to be a bad idea. Everyone uses Markdown because it\textquotesingle{}s pure and simple to read even non-\/rendered. You should avoid HTML to keep it as simple as possible.

To avoid this limitations, Hugo created \href{https://gohugo.io/extras/shortcodes/}{\texttt{ shortcodes}}. A shortcode is a simple snippet inside a page.

The Relearn theme provides multiple shortcodes on top of existing ones.
