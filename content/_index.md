# Manual for the CRIB ARTEMIS
ARTEMIS(A RooT Extesion with Modular processor for Instant Swiching) is used at online analysis for the CRIB experiment.
Everyone can create their own personal directory to analyse the data, so if you want to participate in the CRIB experiment and use this artemis, please check this manual.

But I am not an artemis developer, but only a user, so please let me know if the description is wrong.
